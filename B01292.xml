            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>of the</hi> Woollen-Drapers <hi>of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter.</head>
            <p>IN the Eighth and Ninth Year of His preſent Majeſty's Reign, an Act was paſſed, entitled, <hi>An Act to Reſtore the Market of</hi> Blackwell-Hall <hi>to the</hi> Clothiers, <hi>and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Factors there.</hi> Which Act, the <hi>Woollen-Drapers</hi> not looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be concern'd in, did not <hi>then</hi> make their Application to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Honourable Houſe of Commons; but finding (to their great Grief) that Act to extend to the Deſtruction of the <hi>Woollen Manufacture</hi> in general (the Encouragement of which, the Houſe of Commons has always intended) and to the great Damage of the <hi>Woollen-Drapers</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in particular; have therefore humbly Petitioned to be heard againſt a New Bill brought in for Enforcing the ſaid Act, and laying freſh Grievances upon the <hi>Woollen-Drapers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons why the <hi>Drapers</hi> look upon themſelves to be Sufferers are,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> By the making a New Law, obliging them to give Notes for Goods bought (otherwiſe than with ready Money) upon a ſevere Penalty; whereas it has been always in the Power of every Man in Buſineſs, to diſpoſe of his Goods as he thought fit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, either for ready Money (with which <hi>alone</hi> very little Trade can be carried on) Bond or Note; ſo that there ſeems to be no Neceſſity for the extraordinary Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legiſlative Power, in making an Act for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> The <hi>drapers</hi> cannot but think their Caſe to be <hi>very</hi> ſevere, by being <hi>very</hi> particular; for if other Traders, and the Gentlemen with whom they Deal, were obliged either to pay ready Money, or give their Notes (as the <hi>Drapers</hi> are by the late Act conſtrain'd to do) that then they would have no Reaſon to offer their Complaints to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, but do their Duty in a chearful Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> What will be extreamly grievous to them, is the deſign of the New Bill, which obliges them to pay Intereſt at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> for all Sums contracted for, and not paid at the Day, whether occaſioned by a Neglect in having it call'd for, or a preſent Incapacity in the Merchant or Draper in complying with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> The Reaſon why the former Act paſt, was purely in Conſultation to the Eaſe of <hi>Clothiers,</hi> that they (Living at a great Diſtance) might (at their coming to <hi>London</hi>) know who were their Debtors, and where to make their Demands; which Accounts, ſome Factors perhaps, have ſomtimes refuſed to give them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no Trade, where every Man is Honeſt, and if it has ever been a <hi>Clothier</hi>'s ill Fortune to meet with a Factor that has not been ſo, he has no more than the common Fate that all Men in Buſineſs are expos'd to, and has the ſame Right (that other People have) to the Laws of the Land (with which, thank God, we are well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided) for the doing himſelf Juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is very plain that where the Retailer is diſcouraged, that the Trade muſt ſink, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ill Conſequences that muſt attend Trade in general, by paſſing ſuch Bills, are pretty viſible, by reducing Credit to ſo narrow a compaſs, and giving occaſion to many vexatious and litigious Suits of Law, by theſe Notes being put into Strangers Hands, who will not look upon themſelves to be tied up by any common Rules of Decency, but conſult perhaps their own Neceſſities, and as frequently, a Spirit of Malice and Contention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Order therefore to the better Eſtabliſhing the Trade between</hi> Clothiers <hi>and</hi> Drapers, <hi>it's hoped that it may not be thought inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of the Honourable</hi> Houſe of Commons, <hi>to permit a Bill to be brought in, Excluding all People from Retailing of Cloth, within the Liberties of the Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>who have not ſerved an Apprentiſhip to the Trade of a</hi> Woollen-Draper, <hi>which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the</hi> Draper, <hi>will abſolutely redound to the Benefit of the</hi> Clothier, <hi>whoſe Intereſt the</hi> Drapers <hi>are very ready to promote upon any other Terms than the being uneaſie in their own Imploy, to which the giving of Notes, very much contributes; for a Relief from which, they have recourſe to the Wiſdom of the Honourable</hi> Houſe of Commons, <hi>who they are aſſured, are not leſs Ready, than Capable to Redreſs them.</hi>
